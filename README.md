Hi. My name is Tebogo Assagaai, and I'm a recent Java Software Developer graduate. 

To build my first ever Java profile, I've decided to take old projects and improve their front and back-end so that they can can be easily used for future programming(with a modern approach and anaesthetic adjustment). I mainly tread along the lines of Java 8 and 11 features
(as I did for this current project; from OOP concepts, Lambda expression to I/O and JDBC communication; to name a few).
I would appreciate it greatly if you'd take a moment of your time to inspect and, possibly, share this project. Any advice on how I can improve on my future modifications is higly welcomed. I will publish no more than 9 projects per repo.

PS: This project contains a stopwatch package built by me.It is up for grabs. For free. No T&C's. It includes functional objects(I plan on sharing more of these).
